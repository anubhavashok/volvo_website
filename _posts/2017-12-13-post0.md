> This is the documentation page for the generic single object trackers developed in the Volvo Construction Capstone Project, CMU semester COOP - Jan 2017 to Dec 2017.

# Motivation
The motivation of this project is largely two folds. Firstly, as we would like to ensure safety for the perception system on the autonomous and semi autonomous vehicles, it would be deseriable to have the capability to detect and track the various types of objects. As we would like to avoid having to develop specific models for specific classes of objects, a generic object tracker is in favour. In addition, with this tracking module, object reindenfication capability is also made possible, which would be desirable in various scenarios, for example, path planning. Secondly, with the object tracking module, we will be able to obtain and use the tracked position and pose of the objects to render and create new synthetic data sequences. These synthetic sequences will be one step beyong the synthetic images that have been used in the current training pipeline of the components in the Volvo Construction perception modules and thus further benefit the overall system.

# Overview

In this project, different models of generic single object tracker are developed and evaluated on the various benchmarks (VOT2014, VOT2016 etc). To leverage the data representation power of deep convolutional neural networks, the category of trackers examined in this project is deep learning based trackers, namely, DeepTrackers. The detailed description of the various models and their evaluation results are discussed in the following sections. Furthermore, the setup and demo of the codebase can be found at this [github page](https://jim61c.github.io/Volvo_Capstone_Tracker/).

### Model1.0

Model1.0 is a C++ re-implementation of the state of art accuracy tracker MDNet. With the C++ reimplementation, speed of this deeptracker is 1.5 faster than the original Matlab implementation.

### Model1.1

Model1.1 is a C++ re-implementation of MDNet with custom online update scheme. This model purposely focuses on the robustness of the tracker (robustness is the measurement in the number of times that a tracker looses tracking). In particular, the custom changes are
* 1). increase motion model search range upon failure 
* 2). Per frame online hard example mining.

### Model2.0

Model2.0 is the C++ MDNet combined with ROI Pooling for further speed up.

### Model3.0

Model3.0 is a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network based tracker. It combines the characteristics of high-speed tracker GOTURN and mechanisms from MDNet for a timely feedback on model update. In particular, GMD focuses on a classification based approach that achieves timely appearance model adaptation through online learning. By feeding the Siamese network the paired information of frame t-1 target and a set of candidates sampled from frame t, the network learns an observation model that assigns score to each of the candidates. The score measurement in turn provides signal for timely update of the network. Besides, ROI-pooling over the candidates is used to speed up the feed-forward process. Furthermore, model3.0 is trained using imagenet video detection dataset that has high object appearance variations. It is included in [VOT2017 Challenge]('http://www.votchallenge.net/vot2017/') Workshop (held in conjunction with ICCV 2017).
